# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied

This bug demonstrates an issue where Tailwind CSS classes are not being applied correctly to an element. The expected behavior is that the element should have a gray background and padding. However, the actual behavior is that the element does not have any styling applied.

## Bug Description

The `bg-gray-200` and `p-4` classes are not being applied to the `<div>` element. The element is rendered without any styling.

## Bug Solution

The solution to this issue is to ensure that the Tailwind CSS configuration is set up correctly and that the Tailwind CSS directives are included in the project. By default, Tailwind CSS will not apply the classes, as it is merely a utility-first CSS framework, which means you need to configure it properly so that it's included and activated in your project.
